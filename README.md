# EMAIL-SPAM-DETECTION-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING
Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. 
Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. 
Detecting email spam using machine learning typically involves text classification techniques. You can use various algorithms and libraries in Python for this task. Below is a basic example using Python and the scikit-learn library to build a spam email detector
This code uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, but you can experiment with other classifiers like Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, or deep learning techniques like LSTM or CNN for text classification, depending on your dataset and requirements.
## Overview
This project is a simple email spam detection system using machine learning. It uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham).
